# GRACE - Gesture Recognition for Automated Control of Embedded Systems

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

GRACE is a gesture-controlled system that enables users to interact with and control devices using hand gestures, eliminating the need for physical contact. The system leverages advanced sensor arrays and machine learning algorithms to detect, interpret, and translate gestures into commands for embedded systems.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… **Touchless Control** - Enables gesture-based interaction for better hygiene and convenience.  
âœ… **Deep Learning** - Trains a deep learning model to recognize hand gestures.  
âœ… **Dataset** - Hand gesture data points recorded in a 3D space using MediaPipe (by Google).  
âœ… **Algorithm** - Uses Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to remember gesture patterns for accurate recognition.  
âœ… **Gesture Recording** - Implemented using MediaPipe, a robust framework for real-time hand tracking.  
âœ… **Security** - Uses OpenSSL (Secure Socket Layer - SSL) to ensure encrypted and secure communication.  
âœ… **Embedded System** - Uses Embedded C in Arduino for hardware control and real-time processing.  
âœ… **Machine Learning Integration** - Uses trained models to recognize and classify gestures.  
âœ… **IoT Connectivity** - Wireless communication with embedded systems like IoT-driven RC cars.  
âœ… **Customizable Commands** - Users can configure specific gestures for different actions.  
âœ… **Accessibility Enhancement** - Beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments.  
âœ… **Tank Turn Maneuverability** - Enables precise turning using gesture-based control.
